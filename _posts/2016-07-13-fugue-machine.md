  BACH IN A BOX. FUGUE MACHINE is a tool inspired by composition techniques used
  in Baroque music and Serialism - e.g. Bach's canons and fugues, and
  Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. The idea was to design a tool to
  manipulate a melody's speed, direction, and pitch, as well as play multiple
  variations of the melody simultaneously.
